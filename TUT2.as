/* IN THE LAST TUTORIAL I MADE THE PROGRAM SAY A SWEAR. NOW IMMA TEACH YOU ABOUT VARIABLES AND STRINGSBasically, whatever people say about this shit being hard, they're lying. Some of it gets hard when you have to integrate theorms and algorythms to the code, but when you're doing simple games, this shit is easy to play with. Basically, a string is a set of letters, and a value is a number. A variable can be both of those thingsas i will show you here.*/package{	import flash.display.*;	import flash.events.*;	import flash.text.*;	import flash.ui.*;	import flash.events.*; 	public class TUT2 extends MovieClip 	{		public var nignog:Number = 13;// sets the variable nignog to have the value of 13, public means all classes can access it.		public var nignag:Number = 15;//sets the variable of nignag to have the value of 15		public var nigtext:String = "niggers"; // sets the var nigtext to the string niggers		public function TUT2(){ // basically this means that when the program starts up it runs this. public means it can be "seen" by other classes.
